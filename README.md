## ⚡ Create Inertia Components Easily

This starter kit includes a custom Artisan command to quickly generate Inertia.js React components:

### 🏗️ Generate a New Component

```bash
php artisan make:inertia Components/MyComponent
```

This will create a new file at `resources/js/Components/MyComponent.jsx` with a basic component template.

### 📂 File Structure

```
resources/js/Components/MyComponent.jsx
```

### ✨ Example Generated Component

```jsx
import React from "react";

const MyComponent = () => {
    return <div>{/* MyComponent component */}</div>;
};

export default MyComponent;
```

This command ensures that components are placed in the correct directory and prevents overwriting existing files. It also automatically opens the newly created file for editing.

---

## ⚡ Create Orion Controllers Easily

This starter kit also includes a command to quickly generate Orion controllers along with their associated models:

### 🏗️ Generate a New Orion Controller

```bash
php artisan make:orion PostController
```

This will create:

-   `app/Http/Controllers/Orion/PostController.php`
-   `app/Models/Post.php` (if it doesn’t exist)
-   Adds a route in `routes/api.php`

### 📂 File Structure

```
app/Http/Controllers/Orion/PostController.php
app/Models/Post.php
```

### ✨ Example Generated Controller

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers\Orion;

use Orion\Http\Controllers\Controller;
use App\Models\Post;

class PostController extends Controller
{
    protected $model = Post::class;
}
```

### ✨ Example Generated Model (if not existing)

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    use HasFactory;

    protected $guarded = [];
}
```

### 🔗 Auto-Registered Route in `routes/api.php`

```php
Orion::resource('posts', \App\Http\Controllers\Orion\PostController::class);
```

This command ensures that controllers are correctly placed, models are created if missing, and routes are automatically registered.
